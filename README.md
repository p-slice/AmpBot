AmpBot is an IRC bot created using my IRC bot platform, ArcheBot. It supplies a variety of useful, basic commands, but can still be expanded with more personal commands.
As well as having a practical use, the bot can also be used as a guide on how to perform various activities using ArcheBot.

The following commands are currently available:
- broadcast: send a message to every channel the bot is in
- echo: send a message to the current channel or a specified channel
- help: display a list of commands or details for a specified command
- join: join one or more channels
- leave: leave one or more channels
- override: toggle override mode
- permissions: display or change a user's permissions
- property: display or set a property
- quit: disconnect from the server
- reload: reload the data file
- rename: change the bot's nick
- restart: reconnect to the server
- toggle: toggle the use of commands

More commands may be added soon.
Override mode allows only users with Permission.OPERATOR to perform commands.

Requires the ArcheBot library to run properly.
